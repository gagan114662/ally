# Branch Protection Verification Report

## ✅ Required Checks Configuration

Based on the CI workflow analysis, the following checks should be configured as **required** for branch protection on the `main` branch:

### Primary Required Check
- **`test`** - This is the main CI job that includes:
  - Smoke tests (pytest tests/test_memory_reporting.py)
  - Static analysis (lint/type checking via install deps)
  - Unit tests with coverage
  - Verification claims
  - Proof bundle generation
  - Receipts validation

### Branch Protection Settings Recommendation

```yaml
# Repository Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules for 'main'
Required status checks:
  - test ✅

Additional settings:
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging ✅
  - Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB ✅
  - Include administrators in restrictions ✅
```

## 🟡 Advisory Checks (Non-Required)

These are quality gates that provide additional validation but don't block merges:

- **mqc** - QuantConnect algorithm generation and testing
- **mqc-autorepair** - Auto-repair functionality testing
- **mqc-universe** - Universe/data guard validation
- **mqc-runtime-asserts** - Runtime assertions testing
- **m-router** - Task-aware model selection verification
- **m-cache-runtime** - Cache and runtime testing

## 📊 Artifacts Always Generated

Every CI run produces these artifacts regardless of pass/fail status:

- `artifacts/m8_proofs.json` - Core functionality proofs
- `artifacts/phase_badges.json` - Phase status dashboard
- `artifacts/receipts.jsonl` - Complete execution receipts
- `coverage.xml` - Test coverage report
- Various proof bundles from advisory jobs

## 🔍 Verification Commands

To verify the setup locally:

```bash
# Run the required test suite
pytest tests/test_memory_reporting.py -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings --cov=ally --cov-report=xml

# Run phase contracts
python scripts/run_phase_contracts.py

# Check tool registry
python -c "from ally.tools import TOOL_REGISTRY; print(f'Tools: {len(TOOL_REGISTRY)}')"

# Verify receipts system
python -c "
from ally.utils.audit import AuditLogger
logger = AuditLogger()
run_id = logger.start_run('VERIFY_TEST')
print(f'Audit system working: {run_id}')
logger.end_run()
"
```

## ✨ Status: All CI Improvements Complete

- ✅ requirements-tests.txt created with all dependencies
- ✅ Install steps wired in all CI workflows
- ✅ Phase contract tests passing (3/3)
- ✅ PR comment step for phase badges implemented
- ✅ README updated with comprehensive CI documentation
- ✅ JSONL receipt writing implemented in audit.py
- ✅ Receipts consistency validator implemented
- ✅ Branch protection verification documented

**Recommendation**: Configure the `test` job as the only required check for branch protection. Advisory jobs provide quality gates but should not block merges.
