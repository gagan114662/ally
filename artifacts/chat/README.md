# Phase 12 Chat Artifacts

This directory contains deterministic chat and TUI artifacts generated by CI.

## Files

- `transcript_ci.jsonl` - Deterministic chat transcript from CI run
- `tui_snapshot_compact.txt` - Compact TUI rendering
- `tui_snapshot_json.txt` - JSON TUI data export
- `tui_snapshot_dashboard.txt` - Full TUI dashboard rendering
- `determinism_proof.json` - Cryptographic proof of deterministic execution

## Determinism Contract

All files are generated deterministically with:
- Fixed timestamps and seeds
- No network dependencies: ALLY_LIVE=0
- Stable output across CI runs

## Testing

The transcript and snapshots are used for regression testing:
- Chat responses must be identical across runs
- TUI rendering must be stable
- All interactions generate audit receipts

Run the CI harness: `bash scripts/ci_phase12_chat.sh`
