# Phase 11 Status Artifacts

This directory contains deterministic status artifacts generated by CI.

## Files

- `summary.json` - Current system status summary
- `journal_ci.jsonl` - Deterministic journal entries from CI run
- `determinism_proof.json` - Cryptographic proof of deterministic execution

## Determinism Contract

All files are generated deterministically with:
- Fixed timestamps: 2025-01-01T00:00:XX.000000Z
- Seeded randomness: seed=42
- No network dependencies: ALLY_LIVE=0
- Fixed timezone: UTC

## Verification

To verify determinism, run the same CI script multiple times and compare file hashes.
The summary_hash and journal_hash in determinism_proof.json should be identical across runs.
